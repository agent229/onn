Implements an oscillator neural network which uses a genetic algorithm as its 
learning/training rule. Flexible enough to accomodate any network structure 
and to train by weights or by varying inherent properties of the oscillators.

Usage:

1. Create a GAOscillatorNeuralNetwork object, initializing as desired.

2. Call "train" on that object, passing in the hash describing which
   aspects should be mutated and which should be held constant and 
   with what probability.

3. Recieve back the "fittest" solution found.
