Implements an oscillator neural network which uses a genetic algorithm as its 
learning/training rule. Flexible enough to accomodate any network structure 
and to train by weights or by varying inherent properties of the oscillators.

General Usage:

1. Create a GAONN object, initializing as desired.

2. Call "train" on that object.

3. Recieve back the "fittest" solution found.
