# The OscillatorGeneticAlgorithm module implements the GeneticSearch class. 
# The GeneticSearch class performs a stochastic search of the solution of a given problem.
#
# In this case, the "chromosome" is a list of OscillatorNeuron objects, storing their states.
# 
# Based upon the genetic algorithm in the ai4r library.

    #    1. Choose initial population (randomly or otherwise distributed)
    #    2. Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population
    #    3. Repeat until @max_generation:
    #      1. Select best-ranking individuals to reproduce 
    #      2. Breed new generation through mutation and give birth to offspring 
    #      3. Evaluate the individual fitnesses of the offspring
    #      4. Replace worst ranked part of population with offspring
    #    4. Return the fittest member of the population

    # latest.
    # 
    # Steps:
    # 1. the fitness function is evaluated for each individual, providing fitness values
    # 2. the population is sorted by descending fitness values.
    # 3. a random number r is chosen. r is between 0 and the accumulated normalized value 
    #    (all the normalized fitness values added togheter).
    # 4. the selected individual is the first one whose accumulated normalized value 
    #    (its is normalized value plus the normalized values of the chromosomes prior it) greater than r.
    # 5. we repeat steps 4 and 5, 2/3 times the population size.
