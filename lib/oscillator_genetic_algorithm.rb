# The OscillatorGeneticAlgorithm module implements the GeneticSearch, ParamChromosome, 
# and WeightChromosome classes. The GeneticSearch is a generic class, and can be used to solved 
# any kind of problems. The GeneticSearch class performs a stochastic search 
# of the solution of a given problem.
# 
# The chromosome is "problem specific". For the oscillator neural network, there are
# two types of chromosomes: WeightChromosome keeps track of connection weights and 
# modifies them to train the network, and ParamChromosome keeps track of one of the
# parameters of the wave equation (amplitude, phase, or frequency) and adjusts these
# to train the network.
# 
# Based upon the genetic algorithm in the ai4r library.

module OscillatorGeneticAlgorithm
  
  #   This class is used to automatically:
  #   
  #     1. Choose initial population
  #     2. Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population
  #     3. Repeat
  #           1. Select best-ranking individuals to reproduce (depending on chromosome type)
  #           2. Breed new generation through crossover and mutation (genetic operations) 
  #              and give birth to offspring (depending on chromosome type)
  #           3. Evaluate the individual fitnesses of the offspring
  #           4. Replace worst ranked part of population with offspring
  #     4. Until termination

    # 2. the population is sorted by descending fitness values.

    #    the normalized value is stored in the "normalized_fitness" attribute of the chromosomes.
    # 4. a random number r is chosen. r is between 0 and the accumulated normalized value 
    #    (all the normalized fitness values added togheter).
    # 5. the selected individual is the first one whose accumulated normalized value 
    #    (its is normalized value plus the normalized values of the chromosomes prior it) greater than r.
    # 6. we repeat steps 4 and 5, 2/3 times the population size.
