# The OscillatorGeneticAlgorithm module implements the GeneticSearch  
# and Chromosome classes. The GeneticSearch is a generic class, and can be used to solved 
# any kind of problems. The GeneticSearch class performs a stochastic search 
# of the solution of a given problem.
# 
# The chromosome is "problem specific" and allows the algorithm to make adjustments
# specific to neural networks of oscillators.
# 
# Based upon the genetic algorithm in the ai4r library.

    # 1. the fitness function is evaluated for each individual, providing fitness values
    # 2. the population is sorted by descending fitness values.

    # 4. a random number r is chosen. r is between 0 and the accumulated normalized value 
    #    (all the normalized fitness values added togheter).
    # 5. the selected individual is the first one whose accumulated normalized value 
    #    (its is normalized value plus the normalized values of the chromosomes prior it) greater than r.
    # 6. we repeat steps 4 and 5, 2/3 times the population size.
