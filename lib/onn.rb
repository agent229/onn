module OscillatorNeuralNetwork
  
  # This is an implementation of oscillator neural networks which uses a genetic
  # algorithm as the learning rule. It can learn by adjusting either connection weights
  # or the "natural" properties of the oscillators, depending on the need of the user.
  #
  # The general network data structures are input as 2D (nested) arrays. The rows always
  # correspond to a particular node, and columns to attributes or data associated with that node.
  #
  # This is based on the neural network from the ai4r library.

  #   Hash.create(['Oriole','Spaniel'],['bird','dog']) => {"Oriole"=>"bird", "Spaniel"=>"dog"}
