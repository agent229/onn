# This is an implementation of oscillator neural networks which uses a genetic
# algorithm as the learning rule. It learns by adjusting either individual connection weights
# or the "natural" properties of the oscillators, depending on the need of the user.
#
# (Loosely) based on the neural network from the ai4r library.
