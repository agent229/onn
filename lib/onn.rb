module OscillatorNeuralNetwork
  
  # This is an implementation of oscillator neural networks which uses a genetic
  # algorithm as the learning rule. It can learn by adjusting either connection weights
  # or the "natural" frequencies/amplitudes/phases of the oscillators, depending on the
  # type of genetic algorithm selected from the OscillatorGeneticAlgorithm module.
  #
  # This is based on the neural network from the ai4r library.
